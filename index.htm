        <h1>The Rose-Tree</h1>
        <p>
            <img src="T.jpeg" alt="T" width="70" height="50">here was once upon a time a god man who had two children:
            a girl by a first wife, and a boy by the second. The girl was as white as milk, and her
            lips were like cherries. Her hair was like golden silk, and it hung to the ground. Her 
            brother loved her dearly, but her wicked stepmother hated her.
            <q>Child,</q> said the stepmother one doay, <q>go to the grocer's shop and buy me a pound
            of candles.</q>
            She gave her te money; and the little girl went, bought the candles, and started on her 
            return. There was a stile to cross. She put down the candles whilst she got over the 
            stile. Up came a dog and ran off with the candles.
        </p>
        <p>
            She went back to the grocer's, and she goy a second bunch. She came to the stile, set down
            the candles, and proceeded to climb over. Up came the dog and ran off with the candles.
        </p>
        <p>
            She went again to the grocer's, and she got a third bunch, and just the same happened. Then
            she came to her stepmother crying, for she had spent all the money and had lost three bunches
            of candles.
